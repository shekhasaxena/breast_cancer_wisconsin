Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. The early diagnosis of BC can improve the prognosis and chance of survival significantly, as it can promote timely clinical treatment to patients. Further accurate classification of benign tumours can prevent patients undergoing unnecessary treatments. Thus, the correct diagnosis of BC and classification of patients into malignant or benign groups is the subject of much research. Because of its unique advantages in critical features detection from complex BC datasets, machine learning (ML) is widely recognized as the methodology of choice in BC pattern classification and forecast modelling. We developed 4 robust classifiers to predict if a tumor is malign or benign based on the dataset recorded by University of Wisconsin Hospital at Madison which includes information regarding the texture, size etc. of the tumor. In this project, we reviewed the traditional and advanced deep learning approaches, and recent advances in this field. We show that with sufficient preprocessing and selecting the right feature set, and resampling to address imbalanced datasets, even simple logistic regression and neural network models give superior performance.
